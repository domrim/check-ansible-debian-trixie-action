 Check Ansible Debian trixie
=======================
This action allows you to test your ansible role or your playbook in a Docker Container with ``debian:trixie``.

## Usage
To use the action simply create an ``ansible-debian-trixie.yml`` *(or choose custom ``*.yml`` name)* in the ``.github/workflows/`` directory.

For example:

```yaml
---
name: Ansible check debian:trixie  # feel free to pick your own name

# yamllint disable-line rule:truthy
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Important: This sets up your GITHUB_WORKSPACE environment variable
      - name: Checkout git repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: ansible check with debian:trixie
        # optionally replace "main" with any valid git ref (branch, release, commit...)
        uses: domrim/domrim-check-ansible-debian-latest-action@main
        with:
          targets: "/github/workspace"
          #  [required]
          #   Paths to your ansible role or playboox.yml you want to test
          #   Some Examples:
          #   targets: "role/my_role/"
          #   targets: "site.yml"
          #
          # group: ""
          #  [optional]
          #   When testing playbooks you have to tell ansible
          #   the group you that we write in our hosts file.
          #   example:
          #   group: 'servers'
          #
          # hosts: ""
          #  [optional]
          #   When testing playbooks you have to give one example
          #   host this action should use to test your playbook.
          #   > We only spawn one docker container that mean
          #   > we can only test one host at the time. Sorry
          #   some examples:
          #   hosts: 'localhost'
          #   hosts: 'srv01.example.com'
          #
          # requirements: ""
          #  [optional]
          #   When testing playbooks and you are using ansible galaxy,
          #   you may be interested in installing your requirements
          #   from ansible galaxy.
          #   To do this please provide us either the role name directly
          #   requirements: 'do1jlr.ansible_version'
          #   or your requiements.yml file.
          #   requirements: 'requirements.yml'
          #
          # tags: ""
          #  [optional]
          #   If you want to limit the test to some tags, you can use this
          #   tags or the skiptags option. It will trigger the --tags $tags
          #   option to ansible.
          #
          # skiptags: ""
          # [optional]
          #  See tags. This will trigger the --skip-tags $skiptags option
          #  to ansible.
```

Alternatively, you can run the ansible check only on certain branches:

```yaml

on:
  push:
    branches:
    - stable
    - main
    - release/v*
```

or on various [events](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows)

 Limitations
-------------
The docker container unfortunately does not support a systemd environment. Therefore, it is currently not possible to test ansible roles that do anything in this direction.
If you have suggestions how to change this, they are welcome!

The initial GitHub action has been created by [Stefan St√∂lzle](https://github.com/stoe) at
[stoe/actions](https://github.com/stoe/actions).<br/>
It was used by ansible for lint checks at [ansible/ansible-lint-action](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint-action.git)<br/>
It was modified from [L3D](https://github.com/do1jlr) to check ansible roles.
